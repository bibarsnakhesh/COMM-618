Dear Virginia Department of Criminal Justice Services,
I write to request access to and a copy of Virginia state police arrest records in 2022. If your agency does not maintain these public records, please let me know who does and include the proper custodian's name and address. This request is pursuant to the state open records law Va. Code Ann. Secs. 2.2-3700 to 2.2-3714.
I agree to pay any reasonable copying and postage fees of not more than $100. If the cost would be greater than this amount, please notify me. Please provide a receipt indicating the charges for each document.
As provided by the open records law, I will expect your response within ten (10) working days. See Va. Code Ann. Sec. 2.2-3704(B).
If you choose to deny this request, please provide a written explanation for the denial including a reference to the specific statutory exemption(s) upon which you rely. Also, please provide all segregable portions of otherwise exempt material.

Thank you for your assistance.
Sincerely,

Bibars Nakhesh
