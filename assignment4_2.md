# Bruce Springsteen concert price tickets in major cities over the last 20 years

## The question: How did Ticketmaster ticket prices increase over the last 20 years?

## Background:
The story will shed light on the increase in concert ticket prices during two major events in Ticketmaster’s history. 

The first event is the merger of Ticketmaster and Live Nation in 2010. This allegedly allowed the company to gain wide control over the live events industry. Ticketmaster/Live Nation has since been accused of being a monopoly that enjoys exclusive possession or control of the industry.

The second event is the Ticketmaster’s adoption of dynamic pricing in 2011. Artists were able to choose to sell concert tickets using a pricing method that resembles flight tickets. Congress members have accused Ticketmaster’s dynamic pricing of causing ticket prices to skyrocket. 

## The data:
The story will rely on data that reflect the changes in the price of tickets for an artist that has been popular for the past twenty years. The reporting will delve into the inflation of ticket prices before and after the merger and the adoption of dynamic pricing. 

The focus will be on a single artist. I believe Bruce Springsteen is the ideal candidate since he has been one of the most popular rock musicians during the past decades. 

I will seek data for general admission ticket prices only, and my focus will be on five cities/states. The search will include Washington D.C., New York, New Jersey, Texas, and Florida. 

The data collection method will rely on the artist’s massive fan base. We will follow his social media feeds to find his biggest fans and approach them to inquire about the ticket prices they paid over the years. We will also gather current data for his upcoming tour.
