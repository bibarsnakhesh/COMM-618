# Android vs. iOS: What are the ripple effects of the smartphone operating systems competition

I would like to suggest writing a story about the usage of Android vs iOS worldwide and the correlation between the popularity of certain smartphone apps like WhatsApp and Snapchat.

### Questions to Answer

* The story is going to explore the behavior of users of the two operating systems over the years. It will highlight the practices used by Apple and Google to retain their customer base or grow it.
Apple has been widely accused of making its iMessage system bothersome to Android users who primarily text iPhone users. Google recently retaliated by making text groups more annoying for iOS users.
* The story will aim to reflect how certain smartphone apps (like Snapchat) were primarily developed with iPhone users in mind, and how that affected their popularity.
* The story will also study the affordability of iPhones and Android devices (different brands) by comparing the popularity of each brand with the average income in every country.


I have found this [Statscounter database](https://gs.statcounter.com/os-market-share/mobile/worldwide) that shows the market share value for each smartphone brand and operating system.
I also found databases that reflect the penetration rate and popularity of smartphone apps like [WhatsApp](https://www.statista.com/statistics/1311229/whatsapp-usage-messaging-app-users-by-country/) and [Snapchat](https://www.statista.com/statistics/315405/snapchat-user-region-distribution/).  
I believe the Statcounter dataset will answer many questions since it provides the operating system market share by year and by country.

Thanks!
