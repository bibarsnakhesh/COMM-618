# BBC’s [Gun violence in the US and what the statistics tell us](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-41488081)

* How did they use the data?

The data is highlighted through a series of graphics taken from multiple sources. It is organized logically. 

When: (When did the United States witness the most shootings?) 

Where: (Where were the deadliest shootings?)  

How: (How do shootings break down?)

Why: A series of graphics explain the number of deaths and guns in America compared to the world.



* Can you tell where the data came from? Did they link to the source?

They have listed all the sources under each graphic. Gun Violence Archive, FBI, CDC, and Gallup are among the sources.


* Was there anything about the story that was unclear?

I would have liked to know if there was any outcome for banning assault weapons in certain states. I also would have liked to know if there were any outcomes for higher gun control spending. 


* What did you like about the story?

It was super easy to read and understand. The graphics were listed in an order that made sense. 


* What are you still wondering about?

I would have liked to add a breakdown of gun-related deaths by U.S. state. But since this is the BBC, maybe the local geography of America was irrelevant to their readers. They did list states with assault weapon restrictions, however.


* Did they present the data visually, in words, or both? Was the approach effective?

Listing the data in a series of graphics was effective. The graph of gun-related death breakdown shows the huge number of suicide-related deaths in America during 2020. It’s a powerful graph that answers many questions.


* What could they have done to improve the story?

If possible, I would have added graphs that show guns owned per state and gun-related deaths per state. 


* Where would you take the coverage from here?

I could compare the practices of countries like Canada, Finland, and Iceland where a relatively high number of guns are owned but these countries still witness a lower percentage of gun-related deaths.
