# The United States fails to meet its refugee admission goal

The admission of refugees has witnessed a steady decline during the past decade, according to data published by the [United States Citizenship and Immigration Services and obtained from Migration Policy Institute](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1_J78MxSuVFKZ9wuI77Qy_nHJgd_GqdYH/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=114272850365599444803&rtpof=true&sd=true).

Yearly, The United States proposes a refugee admission cap. That number witnessed a steady decline and hit an all-time low in 2020 when the Trump administration proposed hosting only 18,000 refugees. The United States admitted less than 12,000 refugees that year.

The Biden administration has since raised the cap to 125,000 but has fallen far short of meeting that goal. About 25,000 refugees were admitted into the United States last year. This in part is caused by the decimation of funding for refugee resettlement nonprofits during the Trump administration.

“Because refugee funding was almost zeroed out by the Trump administration, the network of nonprofits who were taking care of refugees and resettlement budgets were zeroed out as well. They have struggled because they've lost so much. They lost so many people. They have been decimated,” said Lauren Carruth, an Associate Professor at American University. 
 
“[Resettlement nonprofits] are not necessarily networked very well and they lost funding from the government at the whims of a politician that was anti-refugee,” Carruth said. 

The United States often came very close to hitting the allocated goal of yearly admitted refugees. Data shows a big gap between the proposed and admitted number of refugees starting in 2020.

Historically, the United States led the world in admitting and welcoming those in need of protection. More than 200,000 refugees were admitted to the United States in 1980.

In September, the White House announced that it will maintain the cap of 125,000 admitted refugees for the year 2023.
