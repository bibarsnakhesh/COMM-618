## Main Pitch

I would like to propose a story about the birthplace of people who became citizens or gained residency during the past twenty years. 

I found a dataset published by the USCIS. The data includes the birthplace of immigrants and new citizens. 

I would like to clean the data to create a story that reflects where people from different nationalities have been preferring to stay in America, and which states have been more welcoming to certain nationalities.

The story will also shed light on the changes in USCIS activities under different White House administrations. It will delve into whether the United States has become welcoming during the past two decades. 

The story could also shed light on the age and sex of immigrants and new citizens. It could shed light on the differences between the number of women and men from different nations.

Potential interviewees are immigrants who wait for a long time for USCIS decisions, in addition to new citizens, and experts in the subject.
